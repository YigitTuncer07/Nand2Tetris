# Project 2 : Boolean Arithmetic

## About

Built the chips required for the ALU, then built the ALU itself.

## How

Firstly I built the Half Adder, then built the incrementor which together allow you to build the Adder itself. It adds 2 twos compliment binary integers. It doesnt have a carryout as it is irrelevent in twos compliment addition, as it is discarded. For the ALU, I explained it in the comments as it was easier that way.
